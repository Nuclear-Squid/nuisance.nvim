Any suggestions or help is welcome and appreciated üòÑ

## Dependencies

Sound files cam be played with `paplay`, `pw-play` or `mpv`. Check with your local package manager if you're not sure.

## Installation

To get started, configure the plugin's options in your Neovim configuration. Here's an example of customizing the sounds using [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "whleucka/reverb.nvim",
  event = "BufReadPre",
  opts = {
    player = "paplay", -- options: paplay (default), pw-play, mpv
    max_sounds = 20, -- Limit the amount of sounds that can play at the same time
    sounds = {
      -- add custom sound paths for other events here
      -- eg. EVENT = "/some/path/to/sound.mp3"
      BufRead = { path = sound_dir .. "start.ogg", volume = 0-100 },
      CursorMovedI = { path = sound_dir .. "click.ogg", volume = 0-100 },
      InsertLeave = { path = sound_dir .. "toggle.ogg", volume = 0-100 },
      ExitPre = { path = sound_dir .. "exit.ogg", volume = 0-100 },
      BufWrite = { path = sound_dir .. "save.ogg", volume = 0-100 },
    },
  },
}
```

You can manage the sound settings in reverb.nvim with the following commands:

- `:ReverbToggle` to switch sounds on or off.
- `:ReverbEnable` to turn sounds on.
- `:ReverbDisable` to turn sounds off.
