# üîä nuisance.nvim


nuisance.nvim is a Neovim plugin that adds sound effects to specific autocmd events. Those sound effects may be randomly triggered or accompanied with a blocking wait. With this plugin, you can enhance your Neovim experience by randomly triggering annoying sounds and wasting valueble time. This plugin is incredibly stupid, and nobody was there to stop me from making it. Enjoy‚ÄØ!

Any suggestions or help is welcome and appreciated üòÑ

## Dependencies

Sound files cam be played with `paplay`, `pw-play` or `mpv`. Check with your local package manager if you're not sure.

## Installation

To get started, configure the plugin's options in your Neovim configuration. Here's an example of customizing the sounds using [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "whleucka/nuisance.nvim",
  event = "BufReadPre",
  opts = {
    player = "paplay", -- options: paplay (default), pw-play, mpv
    max_sounds = 20, -- Limit the amount of sounds that can play at the same time
    sounds = {
      -- Add custom sound paths or lists of sounds for other events here
      -- For example, BufRead can play a random sound from a list
      BufRead = { path = { sound_dir .. "start1.ogg", sound_dir .. "start2.ogg" }, volume = 0-100 },
      CursorMovedI = { path = sound_dir .. "click.ogg", volume = 0-100 },
      InsertLeave = { path = sound_dir .. "toggle.ogg", volume = 0-100 },

      -- Add a delay of 4 seconds before exiting
      ExitPre = { path = sound_dir .. "exit.ogg", volume = 0-100, delay = 4000 },

      -- Only have a 1% chance of triggering this audio clip, that way it‚Äôs a surprise‚ÄØ!
      BufWrite = { path = sound_dir .. "save.ogg", volume = 0-100, probability = 0.01 },
    },
  },
}
```

You can manage the sound settings in nuisance.nvim with the following commands:

- `:NuisanceToggle` to switch sounds on or off.
- `:NuisanceEnable` to turn sounds on.
- `:NuisanceDisable` to turn sounds off.
